# Amusive Blogging N' Coding (ABC)

This repository contains the code from the hands-on blog posts at [iSquared](https://isquared.digital/). The website
mainly revolves around the visual explanation of many different phenomena. There are two main parts: blogs and visualizations.

# Blog Posts
The blog posts are longer and more detailed texts covering some interesting topics. They include explanations,
intuition, theory, and visual perception of the discussed subject. Morever an open-source implementation
is provided for a fully-featured experience. The blog posts are summarized below:

## [The importance of interactive data visualization](https://isquared.digital/blog/2020-02-08-interactive-dataviz/)

The blog post points why the interactive visualization is important and how it can help us in the process
of data exploration and interpretation. It also includes a hands-on experience using the *JavaScript* library
[D3](https://d3js.org/), to code an interactive *Parallel Coordinates* plot augmented with a dynamic table to search
laptops easily.
